    <title>Specialist Carbon Tool Analyzer v3</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Strategic Focus" - A sophisticated palette using a deep teal for primary actions and highlights, indicating expertise. A warm amber provides a secondary accent for important callouts, set against professional stone and slate backgrounds. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: Retaining the successful single-page dashboard, the structure is refined for the new context. 1) Header & Summary now frame the goal as finding a SPECIALIST tool to complement the existing NetPositive platform. 2) The "Tool Explorer" cards now include a "Strategic Fit" icon, immediately classifying each tool's role (Specialist, Generalist, etc.). 3) The "Deep Dive Analysis" section is enhanced. The "Overview" tab now has a dedicated "Strategic Role vs. NetPositive" section, which is the most critical new piece of information. This structure allows users to quickly filter for specialists and then dive into a detailed analysis of how they would coexist with current systems. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info -> 8-tool comparison. Goal -> Compare specialist tools and their fit with existing systems. Viz/Method -> The Radar Chart and tabbed interface are retained for their clarity. The key change is the addition of the "Strategic Role" section within the tabs. Interaction -> Clicking a tool card updates the chart and the tabbed view. Justification -> This explicitly addresses the new context, allowing a user to see not just if a tool is "good," but if it's the "right type of good" for the university's specific needs, avoiding redundancy with NetPositive. Library -> Chart.js. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                <p>This analysis evaluates specialist carbon accounting platforms to fill a specific capability gap in the University of Exeter's sustainability toolkit. While the existing **NetPositive Futures** platform is effective for broad sustainability engagement and qualitative reporting, it does not provide the granular, auditable carbon calculation and reduction-modeling features required for a robust Scope 3 decarbonization program. The goal is to identify a tool that excels in this specialist role, avoids supplier-facing costs, and complements NetPositive without creating redundancy or supplier confusion.</p>
                <p class="font-semibold text-stone-800">Based on this focused evaluation, <strong class="text-teal-600">Green Project Tech</strong> and <strong class="text-teal-600">Sweep</strong> are the top recommendations. They are purpose-built carbon specialists whose free-to-supplier models and deep feature sets directly address the university's needs. <strong class="text-teal-600">Greenly</strong> is a strong third contender, while the <strong class="text-amber-600">SCSS Calculator</strong> is identified as an ideal, no-risk tool for an initial pilot.</p>
