    <title>Interactive Scope 3 Tool Analyzer</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Calm Harmony" - A palette grounded in warm neutrals (bg-stone-50, bg-white) with slate and amber for accents, creating a professional, supportive, and calm visual environment. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard design was chosen to provide a non-linear, user-driven exploration path. The structure is: 1) Header & Executive Summary for immediate context. 2) An Interactive Comparison section with a filterable chart and tool selector. This allows users to visually compare tools based on key university priorities (Cost, Adoption, Features, Usability) rather than a static table, which is more engaging and insightful. 3) A Detailed View pane that dynamically updates. This structure enables users to get a high-level overview and then drill down into specific tools without losing context, directly addressing the goal of making the report's dense information easily consumable and explorable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info -> 8-tool comparison. Goal -> Compare tools against 4 key priorities. Viz/Method -> Interactive Radar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) and clickable cards. Interaction -> Clicking a card highlights the tool on the chart and shows its detailed profile. Justification -> A radar chart is excellent for comparing multiple entities across several common variables, providing an instant visual summary of a tool's strengths and weaknesses relative to others. This is more intuitive than reading rows of a table. Detailed text is dynamically shown on demand, reducing initial cognitive load. Library -> Chart.js was chosen for its robust, responsive, and non-SVG charting capabilities. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                <p>This interactive dashboard evaluates carbon accounting platforms to support the University of Exeter's Scope 3 decarbonization strategy, aiming to find a user-friendly and cost-effective solution that avoids the pitfalls of past experiences. The core objective is to identify a tool that excels at supplier engagement, providing educational resources and actionable reduction plans for a diverse supply chain.</p>
                <p>The analysis synthesized findings from a mandated list and independent research, focusing on eight leading tools. Each was evaluated against a weighted hierarchy of priorities: 1) Supplier Ease of Use & Adoption, 2) Cost (especially avoiding supplier fees), 3) Quality of Reduction Features, and 4) Administrative Ease of Use.</p>
                <p class="font-semibold">Based on this evaluation, <strong class="text-slate-900">Green Project Tech</strong> and <strong class="text-slate-900">Sweep</strong> are the top recommendations due to their robust, supplier-centric, and free-to-supplier models. <strong class="text-slate-900">Greenly</strong> is a strong third contender, with the <strong class="text-slate-900">SCSS Carbon Calculator</strong> identified as a valuable, no-risk tool for immediate piloting.</p>
